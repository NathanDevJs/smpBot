# Minecraft SMP trading bot
this bot is for a minecrat smp, made it for my old smp and it was just laying on my github on private and a few people are probaly in search for this so i thought why not publicly release it

# setup
to set the bot up first make a bot account at https://discord.com/developers/applications
copy your bots token and paste it in const TOKEN = 'your token'
make sure to add a diamond and emerald emoji to your server called 'diamond' and 'emerald' and copy the emote id's and paste them under emerald id and diamond id

# installing nodejs and starting the bot
if you don't have nodejs installed you can install it at https://nodejs.org

to start the bot open up a terminal in the bots directory and type "node ."

the default prefix is ! but you can change it to whatever you like, just edit const prefix = '!' to change it!
